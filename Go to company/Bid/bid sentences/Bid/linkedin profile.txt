My name is Teymur Babayev, I was born in Azerbaijan and live in the capital Baku.
Ever since I was young, I was determined to become a great computer programmer.
But  great person, even though he wants to be, won't do it very well.
Everyone sets high goals, but few achieve them.
I believe that anyone can achieve the goals they set if they believe in themselves, learn hard, and work hard with high mental strength and perseverance.
