My name is Teymur Babayev,  was born in Azerbaijan and live in the capital Baku.
Ever since  was young,  was determined to become a great computer programmer.
But  great person, even though he wants to be, won't do it very well.
Everyone sets high goals, but few achieve them.
I believe that anyone can achieve the goals they set if they believe in themselves, learn hard, and work hard with high mental strength and perseverance.
Passionate software developer with 6+ years of hands-on experience in developing scalable websites/applications using a wide range of front-end and back-end skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, PHP(Laravel), Node.js, ASP.NET Core, Python(Django),WebSocket etc. Also, blockchain engineer with over 3 years of professional experience looking to contribute knowledge in web and blockchain technology. Proficient at performing well as working in a group or independently in a fast-paced setting. A passionate, diligent person who wants to learn continuously.
In particular, I love the MERN Stack the most, and I have deep knowledge and confidence in its strengths and attributes.

Lastly, I pledge that if I get hired by your company, I will dedicate all my wisdom, passion, and effort to carrying out a successful project.
