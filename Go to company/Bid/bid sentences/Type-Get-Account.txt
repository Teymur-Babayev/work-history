I know there will be people who come to you to rent an account by paying you up front.
First of all, I would like to thank you so much for valuing your conversation with me and for continuing to show interest.
If you are really cool and trust me this time, I will never forget your gratitude.
What is that money that should separate us?
I know that if you combine my skills with your account, we can really succeed in this filed, so I keep pestering you even though I know it's so shameless.

I need you to know that by trusting me and helping me, you will have a friend who is like your own skin.
I really don't know if I should talk about my situation right now.
If only you had stopped me a little longer in the morning...

Once I start working, that money will be nothing.
After just 3 to 5 days, you will be impressed with my skills.
