I'm a CTO / developer with 5 years of experience in Blockchain.

In January 2018, I created https://trifidtoken.com as a way to productize recurring jobs on Ethereum smart contracts and wallet development.

Crowdsale Ninja offers an on-the-shelf solution from token pre-sale to ICO including
* Smart contract
* Web and mobile wallet
* API to integrate a countdown on your ICO website
* KYC data collection for whitelisting
* Multi crypto-currency and FIAT support

I personally support all my customers from the onboarding and the Token parameter definition all the way to the release of the token.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ cryptocurrency wallet ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dear, Client! I only work with clients from America or Europe.
An enthusiastic and challenge-driven developer with 6+ years of experience specializing in cryptocurrency wallet.
I can work for free for a week and If you are satisfy my result, you can hire and pay me.
As a senior developer, I have rich experience in this field.
Before starting, I have some questions.
- Do you have the design for your own wallet?
- Do you want only the Web & mobile version of Hot Wallet?
- What do you think of extra security layers (Face ID, fingerprint, or hardware authentication, QR).
- Do you have competitors for this project?
- How many cryptocurrencies do you expect?

Steps for Creating a Cryptocurrency Wallet
1. Creating the overall project logic and planning, including testing and deployment. You can let me know the purpose of wallet development. So I can choose the correct technical aspects.
And we can have a low-fidelity and high-fidelity design of the wallet interface with the best architecture.

2. Development of smart contracts: sell, buy, borrow, swap, and payment integration. Triggering events and adding new functionalities. (Account handling, bundle transactions, transfer limits ...).

3. Backend and database development: some third-party integration and data storage for reaction with the frontend may be required.

4. Frontend development with a strong emphasis on UX/UI design. This is the last step of this project.
I have expertise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Corda, HyperLedger, React Native, and have mastered Solidity, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, React.js, and PHP.
So I can build the perfect mobile and web-version cryptocurrency wallet with these professional skills.
I can work over 40+ hours per week and if you want more, I can work in full time without weekend rest.
Also my communication is very quick so that I can reply your message in short time.
