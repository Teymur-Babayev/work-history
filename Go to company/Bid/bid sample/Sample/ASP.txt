++++++++++ Audit ++++++++++
Thanks for your interest!

If you choose to work with me, I will provide up to 30 minutes of live consultation via a zoom-call, answering any and all questions.

Why Audit?

So you avoid getting hacked
So you avoid getting scammed (if you wish to check a 3rd party contract)
So you provide evidence of security (my report) to your customers

Here is a simple overview of my service:

Methodology

Manually check and revise the smart contract line-by-line
Run automatic tests to find errors
Generate report on bugs/errors found, and revisions to fix them.

What Will You Get?

Detailed report (see example) on security issues & fix recommendations
30 minutes live consultation
Unlimited revisions

The process will take no more than 2 days, and I am open to an UNLIMITED number of revisions!

Finally, many clients have custom questions to ask about smart contracts. I will answer any and all questions, at all times!
