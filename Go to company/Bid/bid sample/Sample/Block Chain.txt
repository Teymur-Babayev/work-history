CryptoCurrency Trading bot
Hello
This project was inspired by the observation that all cryptocurrencies pretty much behave in the same way. When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. Pretty much. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin's lead; the difference is their phase offset.

So, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.

Crypto trading bots are a great way to make money. They automate trades for you so that you can get more time to focus on other things in life. With these robots, it is possible to set the parameters of what kind of trading strategies they use and how often they trade. which time to trade and other resources needed to run on a server and lets you relax and make profits.

---FEATURES---

✅Low draw-down
✅100% guaranteed to win
✅Automatically buy & sell
✅No-Risk and no loss, safest investment
✅Average 60% monthly profit
✅News survivor and only robot for the long run.
✅Minimum investment needed is 200$ but recommended is 1000$ as initial
