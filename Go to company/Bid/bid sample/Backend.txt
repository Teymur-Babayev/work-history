I see you're looking for a website developer to help you build a website

--

You want it to be awesome on both mobile and desktop versions while not taking too much time to
load as your prospects don't have that much patience.

And as your company is based in Nigeria, you don't want any hackers out there to be able to
access your database easily and disclose it to the public. That would be a terrible problem!

--------------------------------

I specialize in building websites and if we were to work together I can help you set up
a strong &amp; comprehensive security system and back up your database automatically (just in case
one day you'll need it).

Here are some of my initial ideas for your project:

- Setting up a self-healing system so your website can heal itself after being affected by outside forces.
- Buying an SSL certificate to protect your domain (this is obvious)
...

Here's the plan and sitemap of the website I just did for my previous client, you can take a look:
https://vanhung.unitopcv.com/Project/zagency/
https://jubelio.com
http://proforma.mobilgenmasa.com

I can help you come up with a specific plan if we were to discuss this more. Are you open to a call to discuss further?
Best regards,
