Hi,

I am a senior frontend developer with 9 years of experience in designing and developing user-friendly, visually appealing, and high-performance web applications. I have a strong understanding of Javascript/Typescript/React including some other frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, Tailwind and MUI.

As a frontend developer I always put much efforts on creating pixel-perfect UI/UX from provided design wireframe of Figma or PSDs as well as creating clean and reusable code components with optimized backend or third-party integration like RestfulAPIs or GraphQL.

I can upgrade your current React website from MUI4 to MUI5, and create beautiful dashboard screen UIs, which would be latest and modern, and mobile-responsive.

I would love to talk more about the project with you.

Best Regards,




Javascript & Node js
