	For Account
---------------------------------------------

All the money I earn in the future will go into your account.
From now on,you asks for advance payment cannot be my friend.
And I can't believe what lies ahead between me and you.


Could you rend me your Freelancer and Upwork account?
I will pay you 35% of my profits.
It means that you will get over $1500 ~ $2200 a month.

$100 or $500 is not difficult for me.
but I must know about your sincerity idea,
It is very important for me in the future.
because I can make a lot of money.

It is transferred to your account.
How can I trust you if you request me this for $100 now and $10,000 will be added to your account in the future?
Do you really want to be friends with me on this field?
I don't think you can go down this path with me.
I guess I'll have to find someone else.

Aren't you forming an opinion about me based on the past few days of work?
Why aren't you sending me a message even though I'm desperately looking for you?
All of this was not all of you, so I am understanding you.
Don't you see me that is trying hard without sleep to make your account great without any feedback or stars?
However, you are appearance does not give me strength and it gives me a lot to think about.
I hope to be a friend who speaks the truth without hiding himself in a cool way, such as saying, ‚ÄúI like it, I don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs better if I do it this way.‚Äù
And I like friends like that.
And I hope that you will be my strength forever.
Then I will do my best for you and you will see my strength.
I write this with a firmer determination to walk hand in hand with you on this field because I consider you my eternal friend.

On the other hand, if you use my account and I tell you that I won't work with you if I don't get results within two weeks, what will you do?
Can you think of these words as coming from a friend who can last forever, helping and leading each other as friends rather than money?
But I understand you generously.
Because my passionate affection with you was not a spontaneous union that took place in a moment, I understand you because I know the side of you who became my friend on this path and is still offering yourself.
And keep in mind that this gustav, will be your great friend.
It won't be long before you get a taste of my wonderful side, and instead of don't saying you're sorry to me, I am going to give you a beating.
HaHaHa...
To my friend Jesus...
