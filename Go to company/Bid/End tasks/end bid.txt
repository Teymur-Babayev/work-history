Hi

It is  a shame that the project has gone the the failure.
Moreover, the time was wasted by severl factors.

I tried my best for you, and when you tried to talk to me, it was while I was sleeping.

The frontend was already well established, so I requested a thorough discussion with you to do the backend, but I couldn't meet you.

This assignment is expensive, but I did my best to do it for you for $50, but since your attitude is such, I will give you a refund.

I sincerely tried to create a great product in cooperation with you, but I think it was my fault that the client ended up like this.

Although you don't choose me, I want you to meet another talent and experienced programmer to complete this project perfectly.

Thank you.
