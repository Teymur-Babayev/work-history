1. Introduce Myself.
------------------------------
My name is Teymur Babayev, was born in Azerbaijan on February 14, 1994 and live in the capital Baku.
Ever since was young, was determined to become a great computer programmer.
But great person, even though he wants to be, won't do it very well.
Everyone sets high goals, but few achieve them.
I believe that anyone can achieve the goals they set if they believe in themselves, learn hard, and work hard with high mental strength and perseverance.

As a MERN Stack expert  who mastered React  with over 8 years of experience, I believe I have the skills and expertise needed to program the idea you are looking for.
Passionate software developer with 8+ years of hands-on experience in developing scalable websites/applications using a wide range of frontend and back-end skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, WebSocket etc.

In particular, I love the MERN Stack the most, and I have deep knowledge and confidence in its strengths and attributes.

Also, Proficient at performing well as working in a group or independently in a fast-paced setting.
I am a passionate, diligent  hard-working a team player.
---------------------------------

2 What is your greatest strength?
----------------------------------
I believe that even details that are not easily visible are important parts of design.
As a passionate developer who is always dissatisfied with myself, learns humbly, and has the spirit of completing to the end what I starts.

My goal is to always create a flawless project and become number one in the field, 
and it is equally important to ensure that it is executed efficiently and optimally.

There may be unexpected errors or other things that arise during the process of completing a task, but if you believe in yourself 
and go forward with high mental strength and steady patience, there is nothing you can't do.
Also, I am sensitive to new things and believe that even if I know something, I have to know it to the end before I can say that I know it and create my own products.
I think where there is a will, there is  a way.

Because I have something like this properties, I speak out loud. I have mastered React...
-----------------------

3. What is your greatest weakness?
------------------------

ok, I think one thing that I can always improve about my greatest weakness.
My friends keep giving me advice, but it's difficult to change, perhaps because it's my personality.
But you can also see that as my charm.
It means that if I set a goal, I don't leave the workplace until I achieve it.
My friends keep telling me that my  bodies are being overworked even though it won't end in just a day or two.
However, if I say that I will finish the work by the next day, I can't break it, so I work without eating.
So I'm trying to fix it now.
--------------------------------------

4 Why should we hire you?
--------------------------------------
Everyone wants to get a job at a great company, but things often don't go as planned.
I believe that one of the reasons is to think about the results of one's own special skills and passionate efforts.

For example, let's say there are two people.
One is a college student and the other is a middle school student.
What do you think will happen if you ask them to earn $1000 through IT development in one year from now?
May I ask you a question?
I think like this.
There is no reason why two people cannot earn money.
It depends on which of them can achieve it faster, and since college students currently have the highest intellectual potential, the odds are high for them, 
but there is no reason why students can't also earn it.
It depends on who explores more and makes more passionate efforts, and I think anyone can do it.

This is because I am a MERN Stack developer who has mastered React through really passionate development work.

if you choose  me you will nerver be disappointed in my skills and I will do my best.
Also I will provide you full time working and try to finish successfully your idea.

My this letter doesn't mean letter of extempore.
We live in the different country each other.
In the future. by way of timeless friendship,
You and me, This is letter of sincerity I hope that love each other and help each other.
This is letter of sincerity
